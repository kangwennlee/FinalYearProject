              shopping in a certain area of the supermarket. The contribution
              of this research is in two folds: we employ a SVM model on

              firstly, as compared with other forecast model such as linear

              behaviour (from 81.49\% to 88.18\%). Secondly, the kernel trick

  abstract = "Dynamic pricing is a pricing strategy in which businesses set
              highly flexible prices for products or services based on current
              market demands. Dynamic pricing is popular because of its ability
              to increase revenue for a company. For the scope of Asia, China,
              Japan and Korea, are include three countries which pioneered the
              dynamic pricing application in electricity. There are three
              different programs are well-known in dynamic pricing in
              electricity which includes Time of Use (TOU), Critical Price
              Pricing (CPP) and Real Time Pricing (RTP). Other programs is Peak
              Rebate Time (PRT). Not just increasing the revenue, dynamic
              pricing can also be collaborated with environmental issues, such
              as dynamic pricing of electricity based environment. The main
              objective of environment based dynamic pricing is to reduce CO2
              and SO2 emissions from the combustion of fuels such as coal, gas
              and oil. This paper is a literature review of various journals

              visitors do and to what they are exposed to while at the site. To
              overcome the challenges of predicting Internet buying, the

              sequential nominal user tasks and account for heterogeneity

              and business professionals in domains as diverse as education,
              information studies, human-computer interaction, and health. As
              yet, the term remains mired in diverse meanings and contradictory
              uses, while the concept faces division on its academic worth,
              underdeveloped theoretical foundations, and a dearth of
              standardized guidelines for application. Despite widespread
              commentary on its merits and shortcomings, little empirical work
              has sought to validate gamification as a meaningful concept and
              provide evidence of its effectiveness as a tool for motivating
              and engaging users in non-entertainment contexts. Moreover, no
              work to date has surveyed gamification as a field of study from a
              human-computer studies perspective. In this paper, we present a
              systematic survey on the use of gamification in published
              theoretical reviews and research papers involving interactive
              systems and human participants. We outline current theoretical
              understandings of gamification and draw comparisons to related
              approaches, including alternate reality games (ARGs), games with
              a purpose (GWAPs), and gameful design. We present a
              multidisciplinary review of gamification in action, focusing on
              empirical findings related to purpose and context, design of
              systems, approaches and techniques, and user impact. Findings
              from the survey show that a standard conceptualization of
              gamification is emerging against a growing backdrop of empirical
              participants-based research. However, definitional subjectivity,
              diverse or unstated theoretical foundations, incongruities among
              empirical findings, and inadequate experimental design remain
              matters of concern. We discuss how gamification may to be more
              usefully presented as a subset of a larger effort to improve the
              user experience of interactive systems through gameful design. We
              end by suggesting points of departure for continued empirical
              investigations of gamified practice and its effects.",

  abstract = "Beacons using bluetooth low-energy (BLE) technology have emerged
              as a new paradigm of indoor positioning service (IPS) because of
              their advantages such as low power consumption, miniaturization,
              wide signal range, and low cost. However, the beacon performance
              is poor in terms of the indoor positioning accuracy because of
              noise, motion, and fading, all of which are characteristics of a
              bluetooth signal and depend on the installation location.
              Therefore, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of
              beacon-based indoor positioning technology by fusing it with
              existing indoor positioning technology, which uses Wi-Fi, ZigBee,

              the movement of a smartphone on a flat two-dimensional surface,

              standard deviation and properties of the beacon signal were

              towards indoor localization utilizing location fingerprinting
              techniques. Fingerprinting solutions generally require a
              pre-deployment site survey procedure during which a radio-map is
              constructed by laboriously collecting signal strength samples
              (e.g., Wi-Fi) over the whole localization area. However, such
              localization efforts have certain shortcomings. For example, it
              is time consuming, labor intensive, vulnerable to environmental
              changes, and the process requires certain pedigree on the
              surveyor that may deem the fingerprinting techniques impractical
              to be deployed over large areas (e.g., shopping malls,
              multi-storey offices/residences, etc.). Newer emerging techniques
              try to bypass this expensive pre-deployment effort of
              fingerprinting solutions altogether. They may build the radio-map
              through the implicit participation of the building occupants,
              office employee, shoppers, visitors, etc. Apart from the
              traditional performance comparison criteria like accuracy,
              precision, robustness, scalability, algorithmic complexity based
              on which the localization techniques were evaluated, these newer
              approaches warrant some additional ones. For example, whether
              they require an actual geographical map of the localization area,
              the percentage of occasional location fix to ensure reasonable
              accuracy, the usage of explicit/implicit user participation to
              construct the radio map, the usage of building landmarks (e.g.,

              additional sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, compass,

              Today's internet shops are offering almost every imaginable
              product and service. This also leads to an increasing competition
              for traditional retailers offering products in stationary retail
              stores. Losing more and more customers stationary retailers need
              to think of new approaches for customer retention. Since customer
              retention is based on knowledge about the customers and their
              behavior store managers have to come up with new concepts for
              gaining and using customer knowledge to compete with bargain
              prices and 24/7 availability. In order to gain this knowledge
              without using vague customer surveys or short-time observations
              an automated solution is desirable. In this paper an approach is
              introduced, which allows to track and analyze customer movements
              through the store. Person tracking is accomplished by using
              aerial mounted cameras and a set of computer vision algorithms.
              Based on the captured movement data customer behavior analysis is
              performed by applying the dbscan algorithm and Markov models. The
              approach is illustrated by a test environment showing
              considerable differences in customer behavior for two settings.",

              improved customer relationships, and it is one of well-known
              tools given to customer relationship management (CRM). However,
              there are some drawbacks for data mining tool, such as neural
              networks has long training times and genetic algorithm is brute
              computing method. This study proposes a new procedure, joining
              quantitative value of RFM attributes and K-means algorithm into
              rough set theory (RS theory), to extract meaning rules, and it
              can effectively improve these drawbacks. Three purposes involved
              in this study in the following: (1) discretize continuous
              attributes to enhance the rough sets algorithm; (2) cluster
              customer value as output (customer loyalty) that is partitioned
              into 3, 5 and 7 classes based on subjective view, then see which
              class is the best in accuracy rate; and (3) find out the
              characteristic of customer in order to strengthen CRM. A
              practical collected C-company dataset in Taiwan's electronic
              industry is employed in empirical case study to illustrate the

              database marketing. Chicago: Probus Publishing Company], this
              study firstly utilizes RFM model to yield quantitative value as

              customer value; finally, employs rough sets (the LEM2 algorithm)
              to mine classification rules that help enterprises driving an
              excellent CRM. In analysis of the empirical results, the proposed
              procedure outperforms the methods listed in terms of accuracy

  abstract = "Positioning is the foremost process in the location based service
              (LBS). With the GPS signal strength obstructed by the wall,
              indoor users cannot obtain their positions with the assistance
              from the global positioning satellites. Most of the indoor
              positioning systems have relied on received signal strengths
              (RSSs) from indoor wireless emitting devices, such as Wi-Fi
              access points (APs). Integrating indoor position information into
              the application on the modern handheld devices can increase the
              application diversity and quality in an indoor environment. In
              this paper, we propose a novel indoor positioning scheme assisted
              by the RSS fingerprint and footprint. Smartphone users can get
              their indoor position based on RSSs from the surrounding Wi-Fi
              APs. With the assistance of collecting ambient Wi-Fi RSSs from
              not only the intrinsic APs but also the extrinsic APs, filtering
              RSSs by directions/orientations, and mitigating signal
              fluctuation, our proposed scheme can overcome the severe signal
              instability problem in the indoor environment and raise the
              positioning accuracy. In order to reduce the time complexity of
              the indoor positioning procedure, we design a close designated
              location set (CDLS) algorithm that only uses the designated
              locations with the similar footprints of current user's position
              to determine the user's location. The proposed RSS fingerprint
              and footprint matching mechanism can speed up the positioning
              process. Meanwhile, to lessen the possible negative effect of
              extrinsic APs, the weighted voting positioning (WVP) algorithm
              would assign higher reference weights to the signals from the
              intrinsic APs, and adjust the weights to the signals from the
              extrinsic APs by their failure probability. The evaluation
              results show that our proposed scheme can achieve a certain level
              of accuracy in the indoor environments and outperform other
              solutions.",

              because of the use of data-mining techniques that allow marketers
              to better segment their customer databases. RFM (recency,
              frequency, and monetary value) has been available for many years

              methods have been developed; however, RFM continues to be used

              marketing segmentation, using two different datasets. It is found
              that CHAID tends to be superior to RFM when the response rate to
              a mailing is low and the mailing would be to a relatively small
              portion of the database, however, RFM is an acceptable procedure

              information and ignore individual difference information (e.g.,

              notion of customer loyalty and profitability to increasing market
              share. Building successful customer relationship management
              (CRM), a firm starts from identifying customers' true value and
              loyalty since customer value can provide basic information to
              deploy more targeted and personalized marketing. In this paper,
              customer lifetime value (CLV) is used to customer segmentation of
              a health and beauty company. Two approaches are used: in the
              first approach, RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) marketing
              analysis method is used in order to segmentation of customers and
              in the second approach, the proposed extended RFM analysis method
              with one additional parameter---called Count Item---is used.
              Comparing results of these approaches, shows that adding count
              Item as a new parameter to RFM method makes no difference to
              clustering result, so CLV is calculated based on weighted RFM
              method for each segment. The results of calculated CLV for

  abstract = "RFM analysis and market basket analysis (i.e., frequent pattern
              mining) are two most important tasks in database marketing. Based
              on customers' historical purchasing behavior, RFM analysis can
              identify a valuable customer group, while market basket analysis
              can find interesting purchasing patterns. Previous studies reveal
              that recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) analysis and frequent
              pattern mining can be successfully integrated to discover
              valuable patterns, denoted as RFM-customer-patterns. However,
              since many retailers record transactions without collecting
              customer information, the RFM-customer-patterns cannot be
              discovered by existing approaches. Therefore, the aim of this
              study was to define the RFM-pattern and develop a novel algorithm
              to discover complete set of RFM-patterns that can approximate the
              set of RFM-customer-patterns without customer identification
              information. Instead of evaluating values of patterns from a
              customer point of view, this study directly measures pattern
              ratings by considering RFM features. An RFM-pattern is defined as
              a pattern that is not only occurs frequently, but involves a
              recent purchase and a higher percentage of revenue. This study
              also proposes a tree structure, called an RFM-pattern-tree, to
              compress and store entire transactional database, and develops a
              pattern growth-based algorithm, called RFMP-growth, to discover
              all the RFM-patterns in an RFM-pattern-tree. Experimental results
              show that the proposed approach is efficient and can effectively
              discover the greater part of RFM-customer-patterns.",

  abstract = "Conventional customer relationship management (CRM) is typically
              based on RFM model, whose parameters are the recency, frequency

              comprehensive analysis has enabled CRM to present parameters with
              time series. For example, researchers can account for changing
              trends based on an RFM model for flexible marketing strategies.
              Such changes might inspire telecommunication service scenarios

              three dimensions in each interval. Subsequently, the cooperation
              of RFM and MCA provides a convenient methodology for exploring
              CRM in large--scale data. Therefore, the RFM model with time

              Although many successful customer relationship management (CRM)

              mining techniques, they basically assume that the importance of
              each customer is the same. Previous studies in CRM show that not

              indispensible to evaluate customer value before developing
              effective marketing strategies. Therefore, this study includes
              the concepts of recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) analysis
              in the sequential pattern mining process. For a given
              subsequence, each customer sequence contributes its own recency,

              An efficient algorithm is developed to discover sequential

              This strategy helps hospital administrators to increase profit

  abstract = "The paper considers a three-echelon supply chain which consists
              of one supplier, one manufacturer and one retailer for trading a
              single product. The market demand at the retailer is influenced
              by the retail price and the quality of the product. The quality
              of the finished product at the manufacturer depends on the
              supplier's raw material quality. We analyze the model for both
              deterministic and stochastic demand patterns. We first study the
              centralized and decentralized systems, and then the decentralized
              system with a sub-supply chain coordination strategy (where the
              manufacturer chooses to merge with either the supplier or the
              retailer and then acts as a single entity) and the two-level
              retail fixed mark-up (RFM) strategy. In the case of the two-level

              ups over the supplier's wholesale price. The proposed models are
              demonstrated through numerical examples. It is observed from the
              numerical study that the two-level RFM strategy is superior to
              the sub-supply chain coordination strategy. Further, the

              challenges among those included in Customer Relationship
              Management (CRM), particularly in the grocery retail sector. In
              this context, an accurate prediction whether or not a customer
              will leave the company, i.e. churn prediction, is crucial for
              companies to conduct effective retention campaigns. This paper
              proposes to include in partial churn detection models the
              succession of first products' categories purchased as a proxy of
              the state of trust and demand maturity of a customer towards a
              company in grocery retailing. Motivated by the importance of the
              first impressions and risks experienced recently on the current
              state of the relationship, we model the first purchase succession
              in chronological order as well as in reverse order, respectively.
              Due to the variable relevance of the first customer--company
              interactions and of the most recent interactions, these two
              variables are modeled by considering a variable length of the
              sequence. In this study we use logistic regression as the

              new customers taken from the data warehouse of a European retail
